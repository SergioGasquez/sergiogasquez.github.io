A PC application has also been developed consisting of a graphic user interface in where the user can visualize the sensors data, both the latest measure as well as a graphic containing the history of the variable. The user interface also allows to water the plan in two ways, normal watering or fixing a temperature and soil moisture threshold, if those thresholds are surpassed the plant will water by itself. Data is also stored in a file at the computer in CSV format, just in case, any further processing is needed. The communication between PC and microcontroller is wireless and done via Wi-Fi, using MQTT, which makes scaling the project very easy thanks to the publish-subscribe method.
