A PC application has also been developed consisting of a graphic user interface in where the user can visualize the sensors data, both the latest measure as well as a graphic containing the history of the variable. The user interface also allows to water the plan in two ways, normal watering or fixing a temperature and soil moisture threshold, if those thresholds are surpassed the plant will water by itself.
