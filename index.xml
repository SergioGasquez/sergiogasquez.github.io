      <description>&lt;div class=&#34;alert alert-note&#34;&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;
    Click on the &lt;strong&gt;Slides&lt;/strong&gt; button above to view the built-in slides feature.
  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Slides can be added in a few ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create&lt;/strong&gt; slides using Wowchemy&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slides&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; feature and link using &lt;code&gt;slides&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the front matter of the talk file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upload&lt;/strong&gt; an existing slide deck to &lt;code&gt;static/&lt;/code&gt; and link using &lt;code&gt;url_slides&lt;/code&gt; parameter in the front matter of the talk file&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Embed&lt;/strong&gt; your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using &lt;a href=&#34;https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;shortcodes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Further event details, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;page elements&lt;/a&gt; such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Monitoring and watering system</title>
      <link>https://sergiogasquez.github.io/project/monitoring-and-watering-system/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sergiogasquez.github.io/project/monitoring-and-watering-system/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monitoring and watering system, that can be used for domestic use as for large scale, has been developed. The system is based on the CC3200 (ARM), which uses FreeRTOS, 3 sensors interfaces have been developed (soil moisture, temperature and humidity ratio and water level) as well as a way to water the plant via a water pump powered by an external battery and controlled by a relay. A PC application has also been developed consisting of a graphic user interface in where the user can visualize the sensors data, both the latest measure as well as a graphic containing the history of the variable. The user interface also allows to water the plan in two ways, normal watering or fixing a temperature and soil moisture threshold, if those thresholds are surpassed the plant will water by itself. Data is also stored in a file at the computer in CSV format, just in case, any further processing is needed. The communication between PC and microcontroller is wireless and done via Wi-Fi, using MQTT, which makes scaling the project very easy thanks to the publish-subscribe method. Besides, a websyte has been developed in order to be able to access the data and interact with the system even when not in the same Wi-Fi network.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Data Acquisition System</title>
      <link>https://sergiogasquez.github.io/project/daq/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 27 Sep 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://sergiogasquez.github.io/project/daq/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Data Aquisition System based on Arduino Mega 2560 will be developed. The system has 12 channels, half of them of the range [0,5] V and the rest of the range of [-15,+15] V. The resolution, in most of the channels, is 16 bits, whereas in some channels, only 4 of 12, is
10 bits. The system will save the data in an SD card and send it, via GPRS, to a website developed to visualize the data in real time. The system can be configured to choose which channels will be on and off. It has a real time clock to keep track of the time and date when the measure was made, an LCD display to show which task the system is performing and an SMU to that will allow the system to measure currents. The system is completely portable and can function on his own in an autonomous way.&lt;/p&gt;
